# Python_assignment_challenge

This repository consists of four assignments challenges.
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Python APIs


Python-challenge consists of two part: PyBank and PyPoll. The main.py file contains script for each anlysis.
Created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
PyBank: 
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
PyPoll:
This dataset contains a set of poll data records and to calculate each of:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote.

# Pandas_assignment_challenge

Created and manipulated Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.
Created a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame.
The district's summary
School summary
Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Math Scores by Grade
Reading Scores by Grade
Scores by School Spending
Scores by School Size
Scores by School Type

# Matplotlib Challenge
In this   assignment, I applied  Matplotlib dataset of a a new pharmaceutical company. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. Technical team will make report of the study and also asked for a top-level summary of the study results.
we are preparing data to generate summary Statistics by creating Bar charts and Pie Charts, Calculating Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Creating a Box Plot.we are also creating aline plot and Scatter plot to calculate Corelation and regression
